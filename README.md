**The Game**  

Space Exploreres is a game where two players are pitted against each other in a system of interconnected planets. The players each start out on a home planet and the object of the game is to have the largest population by the end of the game. 

Rules:  
  
  population growth occurs at a set rate on each planet.  
    
    if two planets are connected by an edge, then shuttles can be sent between these planets. The distance between the planets affects how many turns it takes for shuttles to move from one planet to the other.
